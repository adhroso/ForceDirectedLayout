Networks play important roles in many domains such as Biology, Social Sciences and many more. One example is protein-protein interaction network which shows what proteins interact with one another. Another example of networks is to analyze behavior, particularly in the social sciences.

I this assignment the overall code is already provided. However, first, there are missing components which we are to fill in, and second, analyze how the network is changed with respect to different paramenters. Another aspect of this assignment is the ability to take existing code and modify it in order to adapt same concept for different problems.

One of the major differences between our network and the network from Bandyopadhyay et al 2010 study is discriminating each nodes & edges into different categories. Nodes are classified into Human MAPK, transcription factors, membrane proteins and phosphorylated , whereas the edges are grouped into  conserved Yeast-2-Hybrid, normal Yeast-2-Hybrid, Literature conserved and Literature with each group being different color in order to make contrast between groups. Under the assumption that the source node appears only on the source column we have colored source and target nodes contrast the their distribution. This approach revealed several hubs with the target nodes being the leaves.
